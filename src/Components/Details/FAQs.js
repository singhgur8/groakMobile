    answer: `The objective of this application is to cut down the time people spend\
 trying to decide where to eat and suggest restaurants based on people's preferences.`
    } ,
    {
    question: 'How does this app work?',
    answer: `This app has users, similar to a social media applicaiton. It keeps track of what a user likes to eat based on their\
 past choices and their own set preferences in the app. The app gets better at making choices over time as it collects the data\
 and has a better understanding of what the user wants at what time.`
    },
    {
    question: 'What if there is more than one person who is trying to decide where to eat?',
    answer: `The app lets you create a table/party and add other users on the app. These users have to be your\
 friends on the app so you can view their food preferences. Once you add them to your table, our algorithm takes care\
 of the rest. It determines what the best fit food will be for the table of eaters. The analysis can be viewed in the shown\
 graphs.`
